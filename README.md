# Awesome Creative AI [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome)

A curated list of any and all creative AI projects, videos, and libraries. Inspired by awesome-machine-learning.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence. In short, AI can be used in a variety of different ways, which you will see going through the list.

## Cool Projects
* [Colornet](https://github.com/pavelgonchar/colornet) - Neural Network to colorize grayscale images.
* [Let there be Color!: Automatic colorization of grayscale images](https://github.com/satoshiiizuka/siggraph2016_colorization) - Convert black and white images into color. 
* [Neural Doodle](https://github.com/alexjc/neural-doodle) - Use a deep neural network to borrow the skills of real artists and turn your two-bit doodles into masterpieces.
* [Biaxial recurrent neural network for music composition](https://github.com/hexahedria/biaxial-rnn-music-composition) - This code implements a recurrent neural network trained to generate classical music.
* [Neural Image Analogies](https://github.com/awentzonline/image-analogies) - This model allows you to transfer the style of one image on to another image. By creating a simple doodle map, you can specifically tell the AI how and where you want the style to be transfered to your target image. 
* [Context Encoders: feature learning by inpainting](https://github.com/pathak22/context-encoder) - This algorithm uses context clues to predict and render a missing part of an image. 
* [LevelSyn](https://github.com/chongyangma/levelsyn#levelsyn) - Automatically generate blueprints for videogames levels. Using user-specificied building blocks, the model will generate game levels that are meant to steer the player through a sequence of designer-controlled steps.   
* [Generating images from captions with attention](https://github.com/emansim/text2image) - This model generates a strip of images that illustrate a caption. 
* [Shakespeare translations using TensorFlow](https://github.com/tokestermw/tensorflow-shakespeare) - Translate old English (like the works of Shakespeare) into Modern English and vise versa. 
* [Magic the Gathering-rnn](https://github.com/billzorn/mtg-rnn) - Generate new Magic the Gathering Cards. 
* [Jump City Records](https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords) - Create and stream your own record label. This model generates albums and tracks (along with titles) using a variety of different music samples.  
* [Dadabots](https://github.com/Cortexelus/dadabots/) - This model is used in conjunction with Soundcloud. It scours Soundcloud for music then creates and posts remixes. 
* [Fake Chinese Letterings](https://github.com/hardmaru/sketch-rnn/) - This model generates fake Chinese characters that look authentic. 
* [High-Res DeepDream in TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream/deepdream.ipynb) - Create high-resolution Deep-dream images with this model. "Trick" the model into "hallucinating" 100s of an object into an image.  
* [Generating Images with Recurrent Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/jiwoongim/GRAN) - This model can be fed a large image dataset of objects such as faces, cars, chairs, etc. Using the data, it will generate a canvas of brand new objects in this class. 
* [BetaGo](https://github.com/maxpumperla/betago) - Train bots to play the classic game Go. Intreract with your bot through a web browser. 
* [PyGame-Learning-Environment](https://github.com/ntasfi/PyGame-Learning-Environment) - A learning environment, mimicking the Arcade Learning Environment interface, allowing a quick start to Reinforcement Learning in Python.
* [Cleartext](https://github.com/mortenjust/cleartext-mac) - This text editor only allows you to use the 1000 most common words in the English langauge, forcing you to write more clearly.  
* [Cat-generator](https://github.com/aleju/cat-generator) - This model can be fed a large image dataset of objects such as faces, cars, chairs, etc. Using the data, it will generate brand new objects in this class. This particular model generates cute cats. 
* [Fear-and-Loathing-experiment](https://github.com/graphific/Fear-and-Loathing-experiment) - This model allows for deep dreaming in videos. Train the model to "hallucinate" objects in each frame of a video. 
* [Bots Burgers](https://github.com/somaticapi/botsburgers) - This model creates burger names using wit and puns.

## Video Demos
* [A neural network groups scenes from different films by setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiInSD-u9iA) - This model automatically indexes the contents of each frame of a video so that you can search and filter video scenes by objects, setting, actors, and more. Save time searching through hundreds of hours of archived footage by instantly queing the scenes that you need. 
* [A computer learning and playing Super Mario Bros!](https://www.twitch.tv/givemeallyourcats) - Look at title for description.
* [AI vs. AI. Two chatbots talking to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnzlbyTZsQY&feature=youtu.be) - Create intelligent AI bots that interact with eachother. Give the topics to agree or argue about. 
* [Deep Dreaming Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas: the Great San Francisco Acid Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyxSerkkP4o) - This model allows for deep dreaming in videos. Train the model to "hallucinate" objects in each frame of a video. 
* [Artificial Intelligence and the future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH_B5xh42xc) - In his talk, Andre will explain the current and future impacts of Artificial Intelligence on industry, science, and how it will benefit and accelerate human progress.
* [Davos 2016 - The State of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBceREwF7SA) - How close are technologies to simulating or overtaking human intelligence and what are the implications for industry and society?
* [John Searle: "Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHKwIYsPXLg) - John Searle is the Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. His Talk at Google is focused on the philosophy of mind and the potential for consciousness in artificial intelligence.
* [WADE Pre-Alpha: Artificial intelligence that does everything!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdhiWltjcU) - MAKO is a multifunctional software program capable of opening programs, typing anything you desire, writing reports on anything, it employs advanced user interface and voice input, it manages almost everything in your life, especially technology matters.
